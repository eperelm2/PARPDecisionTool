            As you finish your primary treatment, it is time to talk about what happens next. There is an option for maintenance treatment, which is additional treatment after primary treatment to prevent your cancer from coming back. This tool helps people with a type of cancer called ovarian cancer and their doctors talk about using a medicine called a PARP inhibitor. It's for patients who finished their main treatment for advanced ovarian cancer and have a specific gene change called BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. If you have this gene change, you might be able to take PARP inhibitors for 2-3 years after your main treatment. These pills could help you stay in remission longer, which means keeping the cancer from coming back for a while.
