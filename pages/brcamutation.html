            This tool is for patients who have cancer of the ovary, Fallopian tube, or peritoneum (lining of the abdomen). It's meant for those who have certain gene changes called BRCA1 or BRCA2. These women might be offered a treatment called PARP inhibitor.

            As you finish your primary treatment, it is time to talk about what happens next. There is an option for maintenance treatment, which is additional treatment after primary treatment to prevent your cancer from coming back. This tool helps people with a type of cancer called ovarian cancer and their doctors talk about using a medicine called a PARP inhibitor. It's for patients who finished their main treatment for advanced ovarian cancer and have a specific gene change called BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. If you have this gene change, you might be able to take PARP inhibitors for 2-3 years after your main treatment. These pills could help you stay in remission longer, which means keeping the cancer from coming back for a while.

                <p class="glossary-text">PARP stands for Poly ADP Ribose Polymerase. PARP Inhibitor medicines help slow down or stop enzymes called poly ADP Ribose Polymerase that fix DNA damage. When this repair is stopped, cancer cells with BRCA mutations or problems in DNA repair build up too many mistakes, causing them to stop working and die. The immune system then recognizes these abnormal cells and destroys them.</p>
                <h3>CA125</h3>
                <p class="glossary-text">CA125 is a protein in the blood that can be measured with a blood test. It stands for "cancer antigen 125." This test is often used in women who have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer or are at high risk of developing it. Monitoring CA125 levels over time can help doctors track the progression of the disease or the effectiveness of treatment. However, it's important to note that CA125 levels can also be higher in non-cancerous conditions.</p>

                <h3>BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes</h3>
                <p class="glossary-text">BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that produce proteins that help to suppress tumors and repair damaged DNA within cells. Mutations or changes in these genes can increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer, particularly breast and ovarian cancer. These mutations can be inherited from a person's parents and are associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Individuals with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 have a higher chance of getting breast, ovarian, and other cancers compared to the general population.</p>
                <h3>HRD</h3>
                <p class="glossary-text">Homologous recombination is one of the ways the body repairs DNA and is made up of a group of proteins. When one of these proteins does not work due to mutations it is called homologous recombination deficiency.</p>
